    "1.  If the cluster is especially busy: if the resources you request are available, then your notebook server is started immediately. Otherwise, the request for starting the notebook server is \"queued\". Jupyterhub does not queue requests for a very long time, and your request may have \"timed out\". You may be successful if you try again after a while.\n",

    "1.  Due to invalid/excessive resource requests: for example, asking for a single CPU core and 64 GB of memory is an invalid request, as single core jobs are currently limited to 15 GB. It may be useful to consult the [Palmetto user's guide](http://www.palmetto.clemson.edu/pages/userguide.html) when requesting resources.\n",
    "\n",
