    "1. **If the cluster is especially busy**: depending on the resources you request for your Notebook server, it may start immediately, or may be \"queued\". JupyterHub keeps requests in the queue for up to 5 minutes, after which your request is timed out. You may be successful if you try again after a while.\n",

It may be useful to consult the [Palmetto user's guide](http://www.palmetto.clemson.edu/pages/userguide.html) when requesting resources.\n",
